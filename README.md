# morse-code-and-processors
NOTE: this project was done on MPLABX IDE, i have not tested with other requirements
You will find C code, C integrated with interrupt service routine, and the former integrated with inline assembler code for the following processors 
  - ATEMGA328P mounted on grove board
  - pic 32 (simulation due to hardware constraints) 

The task focused on comparing the processors and the vechile to do this was a morse code translator that translated inputs to LED lights (helped with buzzer noises)

A wikipedia entry for ISR was part of the project for Amharic langauge in an effort to expand education to those who may not understand english
